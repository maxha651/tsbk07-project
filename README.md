# tsbk07-project
Project in course TSBK07 using C++, OpenGL and freeglut.

## Coding guidelines ##
 - All shaders in src/shaders. Add subdirectories to shaders as wanted/needed. Relative path to shaders from executable is "shaders/..."
 - .hpp/.h files should be kept in corresponding place under include directory
